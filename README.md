# Module 1: Welcome & Orientation

## Introduction

Welcome to Level 0 of the AI Literacy Ladder.

This module sets the scene for your learning journey. You'll understand what this level is about, where it fits in the bigger picture, and how to approach the material.

**By the end of this module, you will:**
- Understand the purpose of Level 0
- Know where you are on the AI Literacy Ladder
- Feel prepared to begin experimenting

**Time:** 15 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** None - this is your starting point

## What This Level Is About

Level 0 is called "Play & Explore" for a reason.

We're not teaching you complex techniques or frameworks here. That comes in Level 1. Instead, we're helping you:
- Get comfortable with AI through hands-on experimentation
- Understand what AI actually is (and isn't)
- Separate the hype from reality
- Build confidence through doing
- Learn to use AI safely and responsibly

**Think of it as orientation.** You're finding your footing before the real climb begins.

## The AI Literacy Ladder

You're at the first rung of a five-level journey:

| Level | Name | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| **0** | **Play & Explore** | **Getting comfortable, building curiosity** |
| 1 | Foundational | Structured prompting techniques |
| 2 | Competence | Building AI tools for teams |
| 3 | Fluency | Working with AI agents |
| 4 | Mastery | Designing AI systems for organisations |

**You are here: Level 0** ⬅️

Each level builds on the previous one. There's no skipping or rushing. The goal right now is simply to prepare yourself for Level 1.

## The Most Important Thing to Know

**You can't break anything.**

AI tools are designed for conversation. You type something, they respond. If the response isn't helpful, you try again.

There's no wrong button. No system you can crash. No mistake you can't recover from.

**This is meant to be low-pressure.** Even fun, if we're lucky.

## What You'll Need

To complete Level 0, you need:

### 1. Access to an AI tool
Any of these will work:
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com)
- [Claude](https://claude.ai)
- [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com)
- [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com)

### 2. About 2-3 hours
You don't need to do it all at once

### 3. An open mind
Willingness to experiment

**That's it.** No technical background required.

## How to Approach This Material

A few suggestions for getting the most from Level 0:

- **Do the activities.** Reading about AI is fine. Using it is better.
- **Take your time.** There's no rush. Understanding beats speed.
- **Notice your reactions.** Are you anxious? Curious? Sceptical? That's all useful data.
- **Ask questions.** If something doesn't make sense, note it. You might find answers later—or it might be worth discussing with colleagues.

## About Your Feelings

People come to AI with different emotions. In our workshops, we've met:

- **Nervous beginners** worried about looking stupid
- **Sceptics** who doubt AI's value
- **Guilty dabblers** who've used AI secretly
- **Threatened thinkers** who fear replacement
- **Open minders** who are simply curious

**Whatever you're feeling is valid.** And it will probably shift as you learn more.

## What Comes Next

In the remaining modules, you'll:

1. **Understand AI** - What it is, how it works, what it can and can't do
2. **Bust myths** - Separate fact from fiction
3. **Experiment** - Hands-on practice with real AI tools
4. **Learn guardrails** - Use AI safely and responsibly
5. **Prepare for Level 1** - Check your readiness

**Ready to begin?**
